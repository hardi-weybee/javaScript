first class function

js treates functions as first class citizens
functions are just another type of objects

since objects are values functions are values too and soo
we can do interesting things as
-> storing in variables or object properties
-> pass function as argument to other function
-> return a function from function
-> call methods on function(example-bind method)


higher order function

function that receives another function as argument or function that returns a new function or both
1. function that receives another function(callback function will be called later by higher order function)
2. function that return another function


first class vs higher order
--first class is just a feature that a programming language either has or not(all it means is all function are values)
--no first class function inpractice(just a concept)

--higher order function are in practice possible bcoz the language supports first class function
